## 🚀 Resume

Responsive personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS.

## 👨‍💻 About the activities

My first idea is to implement this website as my personal portfolio. If that happens, I will update this project. 😃

## 🛠️ Original Content

Original content can be viewed in the [TigerCodes](www.youtube.com/c/TigerCodes) channel on YouTube. 

## 💬 OFF Topic

While I'm studying more about JavaScript, I decided to remember about some concepts in HTML and CSS. 😄

My english is not very good, but in the same time that I use my english to get better at it, I use it to learn more about programming.
